# Goodbye Phishers

Goodbye Phishers is a web application that classifies URLs as phishing or legitimate using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The system leverages TF-IDF scoring to extract meaningful features from URLs and applies ML algorithms for accurate phishing detection.

## Features

- URL classification using ML models trained with NLP features such as TF-IDF.
- Interactive front-end built with React for a user-friendly experience.
- Robust back-end implemented with Node.js and Express to handle API requests and serve predictions.
- Real-time URL phishing detection to help users identify malicious websites.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning & NLP:** Python, Scikit-learn, TF-IDF
- **Front-end:** React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-end:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Others:** Axios (for API calls), Docker (optional for containerization)

## My Role

- Trained and fine-tuned ML models for URL classification.
- Developed the React-based front-end interface.
- Built the Node.js/Express back-end API for processing requests and serving predictions.
- Integrated the ML model with the back-end to provide real-time classification.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Python 3.x installed with required ML libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas)
